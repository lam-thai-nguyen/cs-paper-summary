â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ [CVPR] Can we trust bounding box annotations for object detection, Jeffri Murrugarra-Llerena, 2022
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ (Keywords) Oct9-24, horizontal bbox (HBB), oriented bbox (OBB), bbox annotation discrepancy
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ (Problem Statement)
â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ BB annotation is not an objective process, especially for occluded object.
â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ (should we annotate the occluded part?)
â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Discrepancy in annotating might significantly impact the IOU and mAP.
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ (Method)
â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ The annotation consistency is determined by comparing annotated BB and segmentation mask BB.
â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ (This will emulate the human error between 2 annotators)
â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ The relationship between IOU and BB dimension is determined by category-agnostic scatter plot.
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ (Findings)
â”‚   â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ Even sub-pixel discrepancies (i.e., 1 pixel difference) between AHBBs and SHBBs ...
â”‚   â”‚       â”‚   â””â”€â”€ can lead to strong IoU degradations, particularly for small objects.
â”‚   â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ The effect on IOU is dependent on BB size (especially for small BB).
â”‚   â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ Small and medium objects are more susceptible to sub-pixel errors than large objects.
â”‚   â”‚       â””â”€â”€ Discrepancies between direct AOBBs and SOBBs are deeper than HBB annotations.
